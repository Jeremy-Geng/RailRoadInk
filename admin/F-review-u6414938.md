Review Comments:

1. RailroadInk.java: 378-638 Code documentation could be improved to better understand how each step accomplishes its task.
2. RailroadInk.java: 378-638 Code follows Java code conventions as the method and variables are properly named and the style is consistent throughout.
3. RailroadInk.java: 378-638 The program is decomposed into several steps that allow the basic score to be computed from the given board string.
The best features of this are that the score is calculated from the three criteria: Check how many gates are connected, how many tiles in the centre are passed,
and by calculating the penalty marks. Finally, the first two are added, and the third one is taken away to give the basic score of the game.
