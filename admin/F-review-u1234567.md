Review Comments:

1.The good thing is that these two methods can function well and pass all tests.
2.Codes can be more cleaner and simpler if some intertal static methods can be created and implemented.
3.More comments can be applied to explain the logic of these methods.
4.For isBoardStringWellFormed method, names of variables could be more meangingful.
